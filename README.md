# Image demo

To run locally, clone repository and set your datasource properites in application.properties

Make sure you have a schema created with the name 'imagedemo', all other tables will be generated on build

run with 'mvnw spring-boot:run' from root

once running go to localhost:8080/home and you can use the site from there

Notes:

Testing and front end styling are pretty loose in this project, If I had more time to spend on it then styling the front end would be where i'd put my time, implementing it with a framework such as angular/react.

I also only gave examples of the tests i'd write as I had less time to spend on this than I wouldve liked.
